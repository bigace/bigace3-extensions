Installation
=================
To install the SecureDownload extension follow these simple steps:

 1. Upload the extension using the Addon Administration panel
 2. Install the SecureDownload extension
 3. Activate the SecureDownload Plugin(!)


Introduction 
=================
SecureDownloads is an extension to share files with anyone in a secure way.

Every link has an expiry date which can be set manually. Default expiry date is today + 1 week.
Each link can be used one-time, it will be deleted directly when the download is requested. 

You can upload as many files as you want using the administration or you can copy them to 
the secure download folder (see "Configuration") directly (using filesystem, FTP...). 

The default process works like that:

 1. Upload a file using the SecureDownload panel
 2. The first download link is automatically created
 3. Create as many download links as you like, where you are free to use any none-existing download name
 3. Copy & Paste the links e.g. to an email and send the, to the person who should receive the file
    Note: Tell them that this link works only one-time - so if they encounter a problem while downloading, 
    you need to create a new link.
    
Every time the SecureDownload administration is opened or a file is downloaded, the 
SecureDownload engine searches for expired links and files and removed them.


Configuration
=================
There are some configuratiopn settings to change the default behaviour of the SecureDownload engine.

The config package "secure" know the keys:

 1. days.before.removal 
 2. delete.files.without.links
 3. directory 

which have the following meanings:

 1. The amount of days before a file without links will be deleted
 2. Whether files should be automatically removed when the last download link was used
 3. The directory where the secure files will be stored. Could be used e.g. to keep files
    throughout all communities in one folder. You are encouraged to use an absolute path!
    Default path is: /application/bigace/sites/cidX/secure/
