Installation
=================
To install the "Smarty Template Engine" extension follow these simple steps:

 1. Upload the extension using the Addon Administration
 2. Install the Smarty extension
 3. Activate the Smarty Plugin(!)

ATTENTION: Installing the Smarty extension, changes your default layout!
This is done to prevent white pages, when the default layout cannot be found.

Introduction 
=============
Smarty is an extension that allows to use the Smarty template engine as 
replacement for Zend_View.

This is especially interesting for people migrating from a previous Bigace 2.x 
version and for all who want to be able to edit templates/stylesheets through 
the administration.

Configuration/Permissions
==========================
Access to Smarty administration is the same as for designs: "layout".
 
Changelog

1.0: initial release for Bigace 3
